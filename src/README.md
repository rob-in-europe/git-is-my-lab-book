# Introduction

These materials aim to support
early- and mid-career researchers (EMCRs) in the
[SPECTRUM](https://www.spectrum.edu.au/) and [SPARK](https://www.spark.edu.au/) networks to develop their computing skills, and to make effective use of available tools and infrastructure.

I've made this change in the master branch of a fork.

And I'll make a second edit to hopefully trigger the deploy action!
